# Python Alternative Constructor

### Class Methods and Alternative Constructor.

Well, let see you want to implement an independent "constructors", so how to we go about to create one? That's when class methods comes into the picture, We normaly add them as a class methods, which does not call the default constructor `__init__`.

### Setup

1. Assuming you have Python setup, run the following commands (if you're on Windows you may use `py` or `py -3` instead of `python` to start Python):

   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

   ```

### This project includes:

1. Class Methods
2. Pytest
3. Tracis CI
