# Python Alternative Constructor

### Class Methods and Alternative Constructor.

Well, let see you want to implement an independent "constructors", so how to we go about to create one? And that's when the decoretor `@classmethod` comes into the picture, We normaly add them as a class methods, which does not call the default constructor `__init__` whatsoever!

### Setup

1. Assuming you have Python setup, run the following commands (if you're on Windows you may use `py` or `py -3` instead of `python` to start Python):

   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

   ```

### This project includes:

1. Class Methods
2. Pytest
3. Tracis CI
